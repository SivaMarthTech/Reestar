# Simple Restaurant Webpage

This project is basic HTML and CSS implementation of a restaurant webpage layout. The design includes a navigation menu, a gallery of menu items, and a contact form, all styled with simple yet effective CSS for a clean and responsive layout.

## Features

- **Responsive Navigation Bar**: A top-centered navigation bar with hover effects.
- **Menu Gallery**: A grid of items showcasing restaurant dishes, each with an image, title, and order button.
- **Contact Form**: A styled form for users to reach out, featuring a hover effect on the submit button.
  
## Code Highlights

- **Container Flexibility**: The `.container` class uses `flex-wrap` and `justify-content` for a flexible, centered layout.
- **Hover Effects**: Custom hover effects are applied to buttons and list items for a more interactive feel.
- **Responsive Box Design**: Each `.box` in the menu grid has a consistent size, border, and padding, maintaining a uniform look.
- **Accessible Styling**: Colors, font styles, and padding enhance readability and user experience.
